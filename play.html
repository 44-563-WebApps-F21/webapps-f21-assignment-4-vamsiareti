    <h4>The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase - <p class= "stage-direction"> [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
        large yew tree_.]</p></h4>
    <p><h6 class = "name"> LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class = "lady_caroline speech"> I believe this is the first English country house you
        have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</P>
        
        <p><h6 class = "name">HESTER.</h6> <p class = "hester speech">  Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>
        
        <p><h6 class = "name"> LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class = "lady_caroline speech"> You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>
        
        <p><h6 class = "name">HESTER.</h6> <p class = "hester speech"> We have not many.</p>
        
        <p><h6 class = "name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class = "lady_caroline speech"> Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p>
        
        <p><h6 class = "name">HESTER.</h6>  <p class = "hester speech">[_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
        Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as
        big as France and England put together.</p>
        
        <p><h6 class = "name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class = "lady_caroline speech">  Ah! you must find it very draughty, I should fancy.
        [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  John, you should have your muffler.  What is the use of
        my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>
        
        <p><h6 class = "name">SIR JOHN.</h6> <p class = "sir_john speech">  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>
        
        <p><h6 class = "name">LADY CAROLINE.</h6> <p class = "lady_caroline speech">  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
        charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
        damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
        little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
        mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
        distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
        Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>
