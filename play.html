    <h4>The Terrace at Hunstanton Chase - [SIR JOHN _and_ LADY CAROLINE PONTEFRACT, MISS WORSLEY, _on chairs under
        large yew tree_.]</h4>
    <p>LADY CAROLINE.  I believe this is the first English country house you
        have stayed at, Miss Worsley?</P>
        
        <p>HESTER.  Yes, Lady Caroline.</p>
        
        <p>LADY CAROLINE.  You have no country houses, I am told, in America?</p>
        
        <p>HESTER.  We have not many.</p>
        
        <p>LADY CAROLINE.  Have you any country?  What we should call country?</p>
        
        <p>HESTER.  [_Smiling_.]  We have the largest country in the world, Lady
        Caroline.  They used to tell us at school that some of our states are as

        my always knitting mufflers for you if you won’t wear them?</p>
        
        <p>SIR JOHN.  I am quite warm, Caroline, I assure you.</p>
        
        <p>LADY CAROLINE.  I think not, John.  Well, you couldn’t come to a more
        charming place than this, Miss Worsley, though the house is excessively
        damp, quite unpardonably damp, and dear Lady Hunstanton is sometimes a
        little lax about the people she asks down here.  [_To_ SIR JOHN.]  Jane
        mixes too much.  Lord Illingworth, of course, is a man of high
        distinction.  It is a privilege to meet him.  And that member of
        Parliament, Mr. Kettle—</p>
